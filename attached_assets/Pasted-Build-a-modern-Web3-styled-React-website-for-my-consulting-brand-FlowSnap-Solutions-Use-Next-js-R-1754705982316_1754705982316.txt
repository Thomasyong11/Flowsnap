Title: 3 Ways to Save Time with Automated Bookings

Content: (use this text)

Intro on busy days, why automation helps.

1) Use an Online Booking Form (Google Forms/Microsoft Forms; keep fields minimal)

2) Sync with Your Calendar (Google/Outlook; avoid double‑booking; share if collaborating)

3) Automatic Confirmations (Zapier/Power Automate; instant email/WhatsApp; reminder reduces no‑shows)

Closing: reliability + trust; offer FlowSnap setup using tools clients already have.

Blog system can be Markdown files in /content/blog with frontmatter (title, date, excerpt, tags, cover).

Contact

Conversion‑focused form with these fields: Name, Email, Phone (optional), Business Name, Message.

Submit -> success toast, send to site owner email (stub API route), store to /api/contact endpoint (dummy).
